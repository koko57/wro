## About the App
This is the last, fifth project of the Udacity FEND program. The app using Google Maps shows my favourite locations in Wroclaw PL. The places can be filtered by location type (coffee spots, techno venues, museums) or by name.
Clicking the marker opens the InfoWindow which provides some basic info about each place and displays venue's "best photo" (according to Foursquare).
